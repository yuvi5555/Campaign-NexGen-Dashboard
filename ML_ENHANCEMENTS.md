### Model Types
1. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for non-linear patterns
2. **Prophet**: Time series forecasting with seasonality
3. **Ensemble**: Weighted combination of both models

### Feature Categories
- **Temporal**: 4 features (day_of_week, month, quarter, is_month_start)
- **Lag**: 4 features (1, 7, 14, 30-day lags)
- **Rolling**: 4 features (7, 14, 30-day rolling stats)
- **Categorical**: 3 features (frequency encoding)
- **Derived**: 3 features (CTR, CPC, ROAS)

## 🎯 User Interface Enhancements

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `backend/requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage
1. Navigate to the AI Insights section to access campaign predictions
2. Use the Model Training section to monitor model performance
3. Check Prediction History for accuracy tracking
4. Explore Feature Engineering to understand model inputs

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
